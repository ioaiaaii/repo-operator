# +++ Repo Operator +++

**Repo Operator** is a centralized repository designed to facilitate the management and reuse of configuration files across multiple software projects. This repository serves as a repository-level operator, abstracting common configurations and automations into reusable components, including Makefiles, GitHub Actions workflows, `.gitignore` templates, and shell scripts.

The primary objective of **Repo Operator** is to standardize project setups, enhance code consistency, and reduce redundancy by enabling the seamless integration of configuration logic through Git submodules.

## Architecture Overview

### Repository Structure

The repository follows a modular design to accommodate various types of configuration files that can be used across different projects. Each module contains documented, reusable configurations, making integration as effortless as possible.
